    <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
    <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients
        to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p> 
    <dl>
        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>Burpees are great, full body exercise to increase yuor strength
            and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat
            and extend your hands toward, kick your feet back and then 
            forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted
            position. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in 
            a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold 
            the position as long as you can. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands 
            on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up 
            to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as 
            though you are climbing a mountain). <br>
        </dd>
